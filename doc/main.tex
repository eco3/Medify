These personas show a user group, which are in need to take medication. However they struggle to 
remind themselves to take them in their daily lives.

\subsection{Storyboards}

\begin{figure*}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/storyboard01.png}
	\caption
	{Storyboard showing an elderly person on her daily activities.
		In the first panel she reminds herself to take her medication at one o'clock.
		The second panel shows her enjoying her day with a friend, however she forgets to take her medicine.
		The last panel shows her in the evening and she realizes her blunder.
		Graphic created using \cite{storyboard}.}
	\label{fig:storyboard1}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/storyboard02.png}
	\caption
	{Storyboard showing an elderly person on her daily activities while using a medication reminder application.
		In the first panel she sets an alert on her smartphone, using the medication reminder app, at one o'clock.
		The second panel shows her and a friend enjoying their day. The medication reminder app alerts her at the set time, to take her medication.
		In the last panel she picks up her phone and takes her medication, just as advised by the application.
		Graphic created using \cite{storyboard}.}
	\label{fig:storyboard2}
\end{figure*}

To illustrate the practical use of a medication reminder application a storyboard was designed.
Fig. \ref{fig:storyboard1} shows an elderly person, which after some distractions in her daily
routine forgets to take her medicine.
Fig. \ref{fig:storyboard2} shows the same elderly person in a similar scenario. In order to manage
her medication, she uses her smartphone to get reminded when to take her medicine.
